            <h3>Hi there, since you are on this page, I asume that you are interested in knowing more about me. </h3>
            <h3> My name is Joanna Wang. I'm borned China, and got in here at elementry school. Enery since I first started knowing technology, which has been through all of my life, I've alwaus had thoes questions, like "How is video game created?" "How do people make these website and apps that is so helpful?" or "How do our phone screens know I'm fingers are cliking button?" I know this last one are stupid, but this is something that will randomly pop into my brain, I can't stop thinking about it.</h3>
            <h3>I'm Joanna Wang, but my really name that my parents gave me is Chuhan Wang. I made my self a go-by name after I came to U.S., which is 5 years ago. You ask me why? Well, after a few weeks of school back in 6th grade, I realized that no one can really pronouce my name correctly, sometimes, I didn't even realize that they are calling me.</h3>
