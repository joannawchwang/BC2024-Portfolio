            <h3>Hi there, since you are on this page, I asume that you are interested in knowing more about me. </h3>
            <h3> My name is Joanna Wang. I was born in China, and got here during elementry school. Ever since I first started knowing technology, which has been through all of my life, I've always had thoes questions, like "How is a video game created?" "How do people make these websites and apps so helpful?" or "How do our phone screens know my fingers are clicking the button?" I know this last one is stupid, but this is something that will randomly pop into my brain. I can't stop thinking about it.</h3>
